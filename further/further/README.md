For cross validation only with training dataset:
THcg_forest.py applies the Random Forest algorithm of three-way classification  
THSVM.py applies the SVM algorithm of three-way classification  
L1SVM.py is SVM of L1 regularization of three-way classification  
L2SVM.py is SVM of L2 regularization of three-way classification  
Naive.py is the Naive Bayes of three-way classification  
  
nL1SVM.py is the binary classification SVM of L1 regularization    
nL2SVM.py is the binary classification SVM of L2 regularization    
no1forest.py is Random Forest algorithm of the binary classification   

For select the highest dev score based on the training:
dev_SVM.py is an example, others just change the line 35,36 as this one
